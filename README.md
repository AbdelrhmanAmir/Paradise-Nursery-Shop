# Paradise-Nursery-Shop
ParadiseNursery-ShopApp is a React shopping cart for "Paradise Nursery." It features a landing page, plant listings, and a shopping cart with real-time updates using React Hooks and Redux. This project highlights key web development skills in a simple, user-friendly design.
The Paradise Nursery shopping cart application provides a seamless experience for users to explore and purchase a variety of house plants. Upon landing, users are greeted with a welcoming page featuring a button to navigate to the product listing. The navigation bar at the top allows easy access to the home page, product catalog, and shopping cart. The product listing showcases a range of plants organized into categories such as Aromatic Plants and Medicinal Plants, with each plant displayed on a card featuring an image, name, description, and price, along with an "Add to Cart" button. The cart page displays selected items with their thumbnails, unit prices, and total costs. Users can adjust quantities or remove items, and there are buttons to continue shopping or proceed to checkout.
